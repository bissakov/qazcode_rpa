The existing architecture is well-structured, making this feasible with focused effort.\n\n---\n\n## Problem\nCurrently the canvas uses horizontal left-to-right flow:\n- Input pins on left edge (x=0, y=height/2)\n- Output pins on right edge (x=width, y varies)\n- Bezier connections curve horizontally with control offsets on X-axis\n- New nodes are spaced horizontally based on X distance\n\nThis limits workflow readability for complex scenarios. Users need vertical top-to-bottom flow for better vertical screen usage and clearer step-by-step visualization.\n\n## Solution\nAdd a compile-time constant `FLOW_DIRECTION` to toggle between Horizontal and Vertical layouts. All layout logic will be conditioned on this constant using match statements, allowing easy switching without runtime overhead.\n\n### Pin Positioning Changes\n\n**Input pins:**\n- Horizontal: left-center (0.0, height/2)\n- Vertical: top-center (width/2, 0.0)\n\n**Output pins (default - single output):**\n- Horizontal: right-center (width, height/2)\n- Vertical: bottom-center (width/2, height)\n\n**Output pins (dual outputs - control flow, error handling):**\n- Horizontal: right-top (width, height/4) and right-bottom (width, 3×height/4)\n- Vertical: bottom-left (width/4, height) and bottom-right (3×width/4, height)\n\n**Error pins (always right-center, no exceptions):**\n- Position: (width, height/2) regardless of flow direction\n- Drawn separately, visually distinct from default pins\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Files to Modify (relative to repo root)\n\n1. **crates/rpa-core/src/constants.rs**\n   - Add FlowDirection enum (Horizontal, Vertical)\n   - Add FLOW_DIRECTION constant to UiConstants (default: Vertical)\n   - Lines: New (insert after line 3)\n\n2. **crates/rpa-core/src/node_graph.rs**\n   - Update get_input_pin_pos() [lines 375-377]\n     - Horizontal: position + (0.0, height/2)\n     - Vertical: position + (width/2, 0.0)\n   \n   - Update get_output_pin_pos() [lines 379-381]\n     - Horizontal: position + (width, height/2)\n     - Vertical: position + (width/2, height)\n   \n   - Update get_output_pin_pos_by_index(index) [lines 411-439]\n     - Horizontal: right edge at height/4 and 3×height/4\n     - Vertical: bottom edge at width/4 and 3×width/4\n   \n   - Consider adding get_error_pin_pos() method for right-center positioning\n   \n   - Use pattern: match UiConstants::FLOW_DIRECTION { ... }\n\n3. **crates/rpa-studio/src/ui.rs** - Bezier Control Point Calculations (4 locations)\n   \n   **Location A: find_connection_near_point() [lines 145-148]**\n   - Horizontal: distance = |end.x - start.x|; control1 = start + (offset, 0); control2 = end - (offset, 0)\n   - Vertical: distance = |end.y - start.y|; control1 = start + (0, offset); control2 = end - (0, offset)\n   \n   **Location B: find_intersecting_connections() [lines 208-211]**\n   - Same changes as Location A\n   \n   **Location C: draw_connection_transformed() [lines 1465-1468]**\n   - Same changes as Location A\n   \n   **Location D: Connection preview during drag [lines 981-983]**\n   - Same changes as Location A\n\n4. **crates/rpa-studio/src/ui.rs** - Node Insertion Spacing [lines 823-836]\n   - Horizontal: measure horizontal_distance on x-axis, expand nodes along x\n   - Vertical: measure vertical_distance on y-axis, expand nodes along y\n   - Change from: node.position.x adjustments\n   - Change to: node.position.y adjustments\n\n5. **crates/rpa-studio/src/ui.rs** - Pin Drawing in draw_node_transformed() [lines 1225-1427]\n   \n   **Input pin rendering [lines 1225-1237]**\n   - Update text position offset from Vec2::new(12.0 * zoom, 0.0) to appropriate offset for new location\n   \n   **Output pin text labels [lines 1259-1427]**\n   - All pin labels (\"T\", \"F\", \"B\", \"N\", \"S\", \"E\", \"C\") need repositioned\n   - Horizontal: labels right of pins with +X offset\n   - Vertical: labels above/below/left of pins with appropriate offsets\n   \n   **Error pin rendering (new)**\n   - Always render on right side at (width, height/2)\n   - Use label \"E\" or appropriate marker\n   - Offset text right: Vec2::new(12.0 * zoom, 0.0)\n\n### Implementation Pattern\n\nUse consistent conditional throughout:\n\n```rust\nmatch UiConstants::FLOW_DIRECTION {\n    FlowDirection::Horizontal =\u003e { /* current logic */ },\n    FlowDirection::Vertical =\u003e { /* new logic */ },\n}\n```\n\nThis keeps both implementations visible and maintainable side-by-side.\n\n## Testing Notes\n\n- After implementation, toggle FLOW_DIRECTION between Horizontal and Vertical\n- Verify pin positions change correctly in both directions\n- Test connection drawing: Bezier curves should route perpendicular to flow\n- Test node insertion: dragging nodes onto connections should space vertically (vertical mode)\n- Verify error pins always appear on right edge\n- Run cargo clippy and cargo build --release\n- Test with complex scenarios (nested conditions, loops with error handlers)\n\n## Related Notes\n\n- No new data structures needed (constants-only approach)\n- No user settings required (compile-time configuration)\n- Manual node positioning maintained (no auto-layout)\n- Both implementations coexist in code (easy to toggle)\n- See BEZIER_CURVES_ANALYSIS.md for visual examples of connection routing","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-25T22:28:12.0137484+05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-26T11:40:10.7182693+05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-26T11:40:10.7182693+05:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
